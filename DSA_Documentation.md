## Overview
This document provides an overview of the techniques and algorithms implemented for each topic. Each solution focuses on time and space optimization, with the complexity analyzed where applicable.

### 1. Stack
- **Problems**: Basic operations, balanced parentheses, infix to postfix conversion.
- **Concepts**: LIFO structure, stack usage in function calls, and recursion.

### 2. Queue
- **Problems**: Circular queue, deque, priority queue.
- **Concepts**: FIFO structure, application in scheduling.

### 3. Linked List
- **Problems**: Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists; reversing a linked list.
- **Concepts**: Dynamic memory usage, pointers, node manipulation.
